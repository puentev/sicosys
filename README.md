## SICOSYS Network Simulator

Update 06/2006: Fixed some C++ syntax issues to work with gcc 3.4.xx or higher

To compile the simulator read mak/Makefile header

To run simulations, configure and "understand" something read doc/*pdf files :)

Good luck!

PS: In sgml/ you can find some examples for simulation, network and a lot of different
routers. You can test for example ((./ATCSimul -s  M88-BDOR)) for a 8x8 Mesh with 
deterministic routing. This entry is defined in sgml/Simula.sgm. In Network.sgm you can
find Networks definitions and in Router.sgm the router avaliables (Note that the 
simulator support more routers not included). If you are interested in some 
particular case you can ask for it. The examples defined in Simula.sgm is just a little
example to see how to work the simulator. If you want to use advanced architectures for 
the router you can read some publications on www.atc.unican.es or Dally's Book.
